PROJECT: AI Vision System - Camera & Frame Auditing
VERSION: 1.0
AUTHOR: Abhinav Shrivastav
GOAL: Establish stable video stream and audit raw data dimensions
=====================================================

1. DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------
This script initializes the physical camera hardware and creates a 
high-speed loop to capture and display video frames. This is the 
"Data Acquisition" layer of the Sign Language AI product.

2. TECHNICAL LOGIC (THE "STREAMING" METHOD)
-----------------------------------------------------
The algorithm follows these specific operational steps:

A. HARDWARE HANDSHAKE:
   - Command: cv2.VideoCapture(0)
   - Logic: Requests exclusive control of the system's default camera.

B. THE REFRESH LOOP (Infinite While):
   - Logic: Constantly captures ~30 frames per second to simulate video.
   - Operation: cap.read() returns 'success' and 'img' (The pixel matrix).

C. DATA AUDIT (img.shape):
   - Logic: Printing the shape reveals the constant data canvas.
   - Height/Width: 480x640 pixels.
   - Channels: 3 (Red, Green, Blue color layers).

D. BUFFER DELAY & TERMINATION:
   - Logic: cv2.waitKey(1) provides a 1ms pause for system stability.
   - Exit: Listens for 'q' to release the hardware.

3. DATA OUTPUT EXAMPLE
-----------------------------------------------------
Terminal Output: (480, 640, 3)
Interpretation:
- Height: 480 pixels
- Width: 640 pixels
- Colors: 3 (RGB)

Observation: The shape stays constant even when the subject moves 
because the "canvas" size is fixed by the hardware resolution.

4. PM INSIGHTS & FUTURE ROADMAP
-----------------------------------------------------
- DATA DIMENSIONALITY: Understanding that every frame is a 
  480x640x3 matrix allows for precise coordinate mapping.
- STABILITY: The consistent image shape ensures that the AI 
  model doesn't have to resize data dynamically, saving CPU cycles.
- NEXT STEP: Installing MediaPipe to detect the 21 specific hand 
  landmarks within this 480x640 coordinate space.
