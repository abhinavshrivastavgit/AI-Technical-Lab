# 🤖 AI-PM-Projects: Logic & Automation Lab

**Author:** Abhinav Shrivastav  
**Focus:** AI Product Management | Technical Logic | Product Lifecycle Automation

## 🎯 Project Vision

As an AI Product Manager, bridging the gap between high-level product strategy and low-level technical execution is critical. This repository serves as a "Logic Lab" where I translate product requirements into Python-based solutions.

Each project here is a micro-simulation of real-world AI PM challenges:

- **Resource Scaling:** Managing GPU/Hardware inventory.
- **Decision Logic:** Automating feature prioritization and grading thresholds.
- **System Health:** Monitoring vitals for AI-driven robotics.
